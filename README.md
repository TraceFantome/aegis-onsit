# Aegis OSINT Project

**Status**: Early development â€” transparent public research

## Purpose
This project explores corporate transparency and accountability using open data sources such as [OpenCorporates](https://opencorporates.com/).  
The goal is to build a public-facing OSINT framework that:
- Increases access to company data for civic and research purposes
- Provides reproducible tools for investigative analysis
- Documents methods openly for verification and collaboration

## Current Progress
- Established repository for open publication of scripts, notebooks, and methods
- Built first test queries against OpenCorporates API
- Developing tools for automated collection and cross-reference

## Planned Next Steps
- Expand queries to cover regional/company-sector breakdowns
- Add data cleaning + visualization pipelines
- Publish reports on findings for public review

## Civic/NGO Alignment
This is a **non-commercial project** aligned with civic transparency and investigative journalism.  
All outputs will be openly published for public benefit.
