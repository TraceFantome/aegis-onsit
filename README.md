# Aegis OSINT Project

**Status**: Early development â€” transparent public research

## Purpose
This project explores corporate transparency and accountability using open data sources (e.g., SEC EDGAR, CourtListener, OpenCorporates).  
The goal is to build a public-facing OSINT framework that:
- Increases access to company and legal data for civic and research purposes
- Provides reproducible tools for investigative analysis
- Documents methods openly for verification and collaboration

## Current Progress
- Established repository for open publication of scripts, notebooks, and methods
- Working demo against **SEC EDGAR** (U.S. corporate filings, no token required)
- Additional demo against **CourtListener** (court opinions, requires proper User-Agent)
- Built OpenCorporates integration (requires API token for full access)

## Planned Next Steps
- Expand queries to cover regional/company-sector breakdowns
- Add data cleaning + visualization pipelines
- Publish reports on findings for public review

## Civic/NGO Alignment
This is a **non-commercial project** aligned with civic transparency and investigative research.  
All outputs are published openly for public benefit.
